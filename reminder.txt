Ok so what i want you to create is a Web app with react that connects to a certain firebase , my firebase, and also it shows when it's connected to firebase or not , this app is a Structural Health Monitoring but for now we just want to show the acceleratiobn x , y, z of the sensors on this app with dynmaic cards that show graphs of the acceleration variation , and another part the the user could navigate to that shows the graphs , the user can also create buildings and (like in firebase) for example for the data in firebase u have "building_data" as a building , in each card for a building there should be a button for flush , by which we flush all it's data , and a delete button that deletes the building , of course by flush the data should also be flushed in firebase, and the delete also deletes the data in firebase, make the code modular please , We will be working with React , and we will use also Bootstrap , Please make bares and very elegant animations, especially when an element is hover over , or clicked , the theme should be green , and also this project is meant for green energy park ,and my school College of computing as an internship project give me way to add the logos , make it very modular cuz i am gonna be using apis after , please make beautiful, and don't add anything i haven't said here u will be working in shm-frontend
